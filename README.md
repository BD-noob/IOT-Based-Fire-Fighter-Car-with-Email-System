# IoT-Based Fire Fighter Car with Email System

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an IoT-based fire-fighting robot with an email notification system. The project aims to autonomously detect and respond to fire and gas incidents, providing real-time email notifications to users.

## Features

- Fire detection using a heat sensor.
- Gas leak detection using a gas sensor.
- Autonomous movement and navigation towards the fire or gas source.
- Water pump activation for fire suppression.
- Email notifications via ESP32 for fire and gas incidents.
- Remote monitoring and control capabilities.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino (or compatible) microcontroller for robot control.
- ESP32 module for email notifications.
- Servo motor for controlling the robot's actions.
- Heat sensor (fire sensor) for fire detection.
- Gas sensor for gas leak detection.
- Motor drivers for wheel or track movement.
- Water pump for fire suppression.
- Power source (battery or external power supply).
